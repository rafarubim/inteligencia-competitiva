  It does what it supposed to do. Easy to add custom memes. Does not try to scalp you like the rest of the meme apps out there. Oh, did I mention it is ad free? Five stars in my book. As a suggestion to the dev please change the name back to memeful. iOS does not render the complete name on the phone. It looks out of place.

  It does what it supposed to do. Easy to add custom memes. Does not try to scalp you like the rest of the meme apps out there. Oh, did I mention it is ad free? Five stars in my book. As a suggestion to the dev please change the name back to memeful. iOS does not render the complete name on the phone. It looks out of place.


  Great app.

  This app is fun, easy to use and very fast. I can reply to someone&#39;s post or text message with a fun reply in under 60 seconds. I have been playing with this app for about five or six days now. I have not seen any advertisement or any emails from them.

Description

        Cyclotron is a fun and satisfying particle app. Touch the screen and the particles go wild. 
Using multiple fingers changes the way the particles behave.
Great to mess with when you&#39;re bored and have some time to kill, need visual stimulation or want to keep the kids busy.

  Neat but simple

  sarasarasarAAA


  So there are ribbons of color floating around and you can shift them with your finger. There&#39;s day and night mode--night mode having a dark background and neon colors. You can take a screenshot of it anytime by clicking the dots on the bottom. It&#39;s not complicated and it&#39;s kinda soothing.

  Lame: A complete ripoff

May 21, 2017
  Butter up those zombies!


  You cannot even get to the app without agreeing to pay $0.99 for no ads. Once you get past that, you have to pay again to get most of the content. You can add text to your pictures, but it only allows b&amp;w - no color options. You can&#39;t move the text on the picture or change the picture at all so the lines of text fit better. Very bad buy. A complete rip off.

  App is functional but only offers a small quantity of
Free meme options. The number of templates available is too few to justify paying when imgflip(dot)com has it for free.

  One more thing

Apr 7, 2017
  DaPrincessofPink


  Hey I recently finished another review but there&#39;s one thing I forgot: multiple memes at one time. Sometimes I wanna make a comic-strip like meme but I just end up making everything one pic at a time and make sure no other picture comes between it. This is a problem for me because if my friends are over and I&#39;m making a meme, my one friend loves taking pictures so she&#39;ll probably slip my phone out of my hands and take some selfies, and my storage is almost full so I cannot recover deleted photos later. Fix this and everything else I said, and five stars. Once more, DaPrincessofPink out âœŒðŸ¾

  Awesome but...

Dec 22, 2015
  Spoons5421


  I love reading rage comics on this but there are some things you wanna fix. First of all, everytime I click a rage comic this weird thing happens where there is a huge space in between the top of the screen and the comic. If won&#39;t let me scroll down and the only way to fix it is by flipping the screen horizontally and back and it gets really annoying. Next, in my favorites list, I can only read the comic on the top if the page, even if I click a different one. Lastly, the featured page never updates. The ones currently on me evade are WAAAAY different than the ones here. If your reading this, I hope you fix these.

  Best app Iâ€™ve found.

Sep 23, 2017
  GShades


  First time Iâ€™ve ever took the time to review an app. This one is worth it. Not some stripped down useless annoying app. I have found myself in the clutches of a full blown meme addiction. Whatever I see I think, thatâ€™s memeable. I know, what youâ€™re thinking and youâ€™re right because of this app not only is my meme folder growing but I am drowning in women now all thanks to this app. They canâ€™t get enough of me now. Truly has changed my life. You wonâ€™t regret it.

  I downloaded several meme creators and all of them except this one had ads that you had to pay to remove and a watermark on your meme. This app works well, has no ads and the in app purchases are both optional and a great value. They offer various themed image packs that you can use to create awesome memes! A+++ Five Stars all the way for this app!

Pe mÄƒsurÄƒ ce alungii dracii sfinÅ£ind persoane sau obiecte, poÅ£i creÅŸte Ã®n rang! AplicaÅ£ia noastrÄƒ vine astfel Ã®n ajutorul celor care iau Ã®n calcul o carierÄƒ de exorcist full-time.
AtenÅ£ie: Busuioc Automat 3000 este realizat de cercetÄƒtori independenÅ£i ÅŸi nu este afiliat niciunui cult religios real sau fictiv. Nu este recomandat persoanelor alergice la busuioc.

O poder do hÃ¡bito: Por que fazemos o que fazemos na vida e nos negÃ³cios
Charles Duhigg

R$Â 29,90
  Charles Duhigg, repÃ³rter investigativo do New York Times, mostra que a chave para o sucesso Ã© entender como os hÃ¡bitos funcionam - e como podemos transformÃ¡-los. Durante os Ãºltimos dois anos, uma jovem transformou quase todos os aspectos de sua vida. Parou de fumar, correu uma maratona e foi promovida. Em um laboratÃ³rio, neurologistas descobriram que os padrÃµes dentro do cÃ©rebro dela mudaram de maneira fundamental. PublicitÃ¡rios da Procter &amp; Gamble observaram vÃ­deos de pessoas fazendo a cama. Tentavam desesperadamente descobrir como vender um novo produto chamado Febreze, que estava prestes a se tornar um dos maiores fracassos na histÃ³ria da empresa. De repente, um deles detecta um padrÃ£o quase imperceptÃ­vel - e, com uma sutil mudanÃ§a na campanha publicitÃ¡ria, Febreze comeÃ§a a vender um bilhÃ£o de dÃ³lares por anos. Um diretor executivo pouco conhecido assume uma das maiores empresas norte-americanas. Seu primeiro passo Ã© atacar um Ãºnico padrÃ£o entre os funcionÃ¡rios - a maneira como lidam com a seguranÃ§a no ambiente de trabalho -, e logo a empresa comeÃ§a a ter o melhor desempenho no Ã­ndice Dow Jones. O que todas essas pessoas tem em comum? Conseguiram ter sucesso focando em padrÃµes que moldam cada aspecto de nossas vidas. Tiveram Ãªxito transformando hÃ¡bitos. Com perspicÃ¡cia e habilidade, Charles Duhigg apresenta um novo entendimento da natureza humana e seu potencial para a transformaÃ§Ã£o.

Me Poupe!: 10 passos para nunca mais faltar dinheiro no seu bolso

R$Â 18,99
  Como economizar no dia a dia? Como poupar mesmo ganhando pouco? Quais sÃ£o os melhores (e os piores) investimentos? Como poupar para o futuro sem abrir mÃ£o dos desejos e necessidades do presente?Sei que vocÃª tem muitas dÃºvidas sobre o que fazer com o seu dinheiro. Sei tambÃ©m que muita gente simplesmente nÃ£o faz nada com ele â€“ a nÃ£o ser pagar contas e juntar moedinhas para chegar atÃ© o fim do mÃªs.Ã‰ por isso que estou aqui.Sempre fui uma poupadora compulsiva. Desde cedo compreendi que precisaria juntar dinheiro para realizar meus sonhos. Aos 7 anos comecei a poupar para comprar um carro quando fizesse 18. Com 23 comprei meu primeiro apartamento Ã  vista. Aos 30 pedi demissÃ£o do meu emprego de repÃ³rter de TV e montei o canal Me Poupe!, no YouTube. Aos 32 me tornei milionÃ¡ria.Hoje o Me Poupe! tem mais de 1,5 milhÃ£o de inscritos e Ã© visto por mais de 8 milhÃµes de pessoas por mÃªs, sendo pioneiro na criaÃ§Ã£o do conceito de entretenimento financeiro ao falar de dinheiro com leveza e bom humor. Tenho orgulho de dizer que, aos 35 anos, estou perto de conquistar minha independÃªncia financeira.Vou contar para vocÃª como cheguei atÃ© aqui, as roubadas em que me meti, as dÃºvidas que tive e tudo o que aprendi ao longo desses anos. Mas este livro nÃ£o Ã© sobre mim. Ã‰ sobre vocÃª, o seu dinheiro e a maneira como vem lidando com ele atÃ© agora.Eu resolvi escrevÃª-lo para passar uma mensagem curta e grossa: vocÃª pode sair do buraco, nÃ£o importa qual o tamanho dele.Para ajudar nesse processo, reuni exemplos prÃ¡ticos, situaÃ§Ãµes reais, planilhas e exercÃ­cios, e organizei tudo isso em 10 passos simples para nunca mais faltar dinheiro no seu bolso.A partir dessas dicas, vocÃª vai aprender a dar um basta nos hÃ¡bitos que sabotam sua saÃºde financeira, a identificar as crenÃ§as que impedem seu enriquecimento e a encontrar modalidades de investimento que caibam na sua realidade. E o melhor: vai descobrir um mundo maravilhoso em que o dinheiro trabalha para vocÃª, e nÃ£o vocÃª para ele.Mas talvez a minha dica mais importante seja: poupar nÃ£o Ã© sÃ³ acumular um monte de dinheiro. Poupar tem a ver com realizar sonhos. Ã‰ necessÃ¡rio ter foco, estabelecer prioridades e atÃ© abrir mÃ£o de uma ou outra coisa em nome de um objetivo maior.Eu poupo desde crianÃ§a porque tenho metas e propÃ³sitos. E essas metas e propÃ³sitos tÃªm a ver com pessoas e com experiÃªncias, porque, afinal, viver nÃ£o Ã© correr atrÃ¡s de grana. A vida vale pelas experiÃªncias que o dinheiro nos proporciona, pelos encontros que temos pelo caminho e pela alegria de estarmos vivos todos os dias.Nathalia Arcuri &quot;Os fÃ£s do canal Me Poupe! nÃ£o vÃ£o se decepcionar. Nathalia Arcuri venceu o desafio de levar para o papel a linguagem que se tornou sua marca registrada, o que deve fidelizar multidÃµes e reforÃ§ar o propÃ³sito de seu trabalho. VocÃª tem em mÃ£os um instrumento de transformaÃ§Ã£o. Leia-o com sabedoria e coloque em prÃ¡tica o que encontrar aqui. Sua vida serÃ¡ outra, certamente mais rica, depois desta leitura.&quot; â€“ Gustavo Cerbasi

Ele conta umas piadas aqui, dÃ¡ uns exemplos inusitados ali, joga umas verdades na sua cara e pronto, vocÃª jÃ¡ se sente muito mais alerta e capaz de enfrentar esse mundo cÃ£o.
 Para os cÃ©ticos e os descrentes, mas tambÃ©m para os amantes do gÃªnero, enfim uma abordagem franca e inteligente que vai ajudar vocÃª a descobrir o que Ã© realmente importante na sua vida, e f*da-se o resto.

Ele define nossa relaÃ§Ã£o com o trabalho e com as pessoas e a maneira como educamos nossos filhos. Ã‰ um fator decisivo para que todo o nosso potencial seja explorado.

Preso a uma cadeira de rodas depois de um acidente de moto, o antes ativo e esportivo Will desconta toda a sua amargura em quem estiver por perto. Tudo parece pequeno e sem graÃ§a para ele, que sabe exatamente como dar um fim a esse sentimento. O que Will nÃ£o sabe Ã© que Lou estÃ¡ prestes a trazer cor a sua vida. E nenhum dos dois desconfia de que irÃ¡ mudar para sempre a histÃ³ria um do outro. Como eu era antes de vocÃª Ã© uma histÃ³ria de amor e uma histÃ³ria de famÃ­lia, mas acima de tudo Ã© uma histÃ³ria sobre a coragem e o esforÃ§o necessÃ¡rios para retomar a vida quando tudo parece acabado.

A menina que roubava livros

R$Â 34,90
R$Â 13,96
  A trajetÃ³ria de Liesel Meminger Ã© contada por uma narradora mÃ³rbida, surpreendentemente simpÃ¡tica. Ao perceber que a pequena ladra de livros lhe escapa, a Morte afeiÃ§oa-se Ã  menina e rastreia suas pegadas de 1939 a 1943. TraÃ§os de uma sobrevivente: a mÃ£e comunista, perseguida pelo nazismo, envia Liesel e o irmÃ£o para o subÃºrbio pobre de uma cidade alemÃ£, onde um casal se dispÃµe a adotÃ¡-los por dinheiro. O garoto morre no trajeto e Ã© enterrado por um coveiro que deixa cair um livro na neve. Ã‰ o primeiro de uma sÃ©rie que a menina vai surrupiar ao longo dos anos. O Ãºnico vÃ­nculo com a famÃ­lia Ã© esta obra, que ela ainda nÃ£o sabe ler. Assombrada por pesadelos, ela compensa o medo e a solidÃ£o das noites com a conivÃªncia do pai adotivo, um pintor de parede bonachÃ£o que lhe dÃ¡ liÃ§Ãµes de leitura. Alfabetizada sob vistas grossas da madrasta, Liesel canaliza urgÃªncias para a literatura. Em tempos de livros incendiados, ela os furta, ou os lÃª na biblioteca do prefeito da cidade. A vida ao redor Ã© a pseudo-realidade criada em torno do culto a Hitler na Segunda Guerra. Ela assiste Ã  eufÃ³rica celebraÃ§Ã£o do aniversÃ¡rio do FÃ¼hrer pela vizinhanÃ§a. Teme a dona da loja da esquina, colaboradora do Terceiro Reich. Faz amizade com um garoto obrigado a integrar a Juventude Hitlerista. E ajuda o pai a esconder no porÃ£o um judeu que escreve livros artesanais para contar a sua parte naquela HistÃ³ria. A Morte, perplexa diante da violÃªncia humana, dÃ¡ um tom leve e divertido Ã  narrativa deste duro confronto entre a infÃ¢ncia perdida e a crueldade do mundo adulto, um sucesso absoluto - e raro - de crÃ­tica e pÃºblico.

  Deadpool 2 Ã© um filme de aÃ§Ã£o e comÃ©dia estadunidense de 2018, baseado no personagem de mesmo nome da Marvel Comics, dirigido por David Leitch e escrito por Rhett Reese e Paul Wernick, sendo a sequÃªncia de Deadpool, de 2016, e o dÃ©cimo primeiro filme da sÃ©rie X-Men. DistribuÃ­do pela 20th Century Fox, Ã© estrelado por Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin, Zazie Beetz, Julian Dennison, Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller e Brianna Hildebrand.
Os planos de uma sequÃªncia para Deadpool comeÃ§aram antes mesmo do lanÃ§amento do primeiro filme, o que foi confirmado em fevereiro de 2016. Embora a equipe criativa original formada por Reynolds, Reese, Wernick e pelo diretor Tim Miller tivesse o retorno assegurado, Miller deixou o projeto em outubro de 2016 devido a diferenÃ§as criativas com Reynolds, fazendo com que ele fosse substituÃ­do por David Leitch, um dos diretores do longa-metragem John Wick. Uma extensa pesquisa de elenco foi realizada para encontrar o ator que interpretaria Nathan Summers/Cable. Disputando a vaga com nomes como David Harbour e Michael Shannon, Josh Brolin acabou ganhando o papel e assinou contrato com a 20th Century Fox para dar vida ao personagem em quatro produÃ§Ãµes da franquia X-Men.

  &quot;Maktub nÃ£o Ã© um livro de conselhos â€” mas uma troca de experiÃªncias.&quot; â€” Paulo Coelho Durante um ano, Paulo Coelho teve uma coluna diÃ¡ria chamada Maktub no jornal Folha de S.Paulo. Nela, publicava curtÃ­ssimos textos sobre os pensamentos e as inquietaÃ§Ãµes de diversas culturas. Como resultado, o autor recebia diariamente diversas cartas de leitores dizendo o quanto as colunas os inspiravam e que alguns chegavam a recortar o jornal para guardar seus textos preferidos. Foi daÃ­ que surgiu a ideia deste livro. Os textos que aqui estÃ£o sÃ£o pequenas histÃ³rias, fÃ¡bulas que nos convidam a pensar e ver a vida a partir de novos pontos de vista, uma oportunidade para refletir e se encontrar consigo mesmo novamente. Para redigi-los, Paulo Coelho teve como inspiraÃ§Ã£o histÃ³rias da sabedoria universal que tratam da busca da felicidade â€“ uma temÃ¡tica extremamente atual que nos leva a pensar sobre as nossas prÃ³prias verdades ao conhecer narrativas tÃ£o diversas. &quot;O talento de escritor do senhor Paulo Coelho, bem como sua excepcional capacidade em tocar as vidas dos homens e mulheres, por entre fronteiras e culturas, faz dele um mensageiro poderoso.&quot; â€” Ban Ki-Moon, secretÃ¡rio-geral das NaÃ§Ãµes Unidas &quot;Acreditamos nas palavras de Paulo Coelho, em um de seus mais famosos livros: &#39;Com a forÃ§a de nosso amor e de nossa vontade podemos mudar nosso destino e tambÃ©m os destinos de outros&#39;.&quot; â€” Barack Obama, ex-presidente dos Estados Unidos &quot;Paulo Coelho conhece o segredo da alquimia literÃ¡ria.&quot; â€” Kenzaburo Oe, PrÃªmio Nobel de literatura

Com base em mais de duzentas entrevistas, Wolff apresenta com riqueza de detalhes revelaÃ§Ãµes como: Trump e seus assessores mais diretos nunca acreditaram que ganhariam a eleiÃ§Ã£oNinguÃ©m na equipe de Donald Trump acredita que ele tem capacidade para governar os EUANinguÃ©m entende o relacionamento de Trump com a mulher MelaniaA filha Ivanka conta como Donald Trump faz o penteado peculiar de seu cabeloO autor revela que a polÃ­tica moderna se faz mais com o conflito do que com o consensoFogo e fÃºria Ã© um livro fundamental para entender o mundo da polÃ­tica contemporÃ¢nea.

R$Â 9,90
  Â Richard VanRyan Ã© um playboy e executivo tirano que trabalha para uma empresa que visa apenas lucros. ApÃ³s ser passado para trÃ¡s por um colega de trabalho, acabou nÃ£o conseguindo fazer parte da sociedade que tanto queria.

Mas Richard precisa mostrar que mudou de vida e, para isso, decide contratar Katharine, que ele sempre desprezou, para ser sua noiva de fachada. O que acontece quando duas pessoas que se odeiam tÃªm de viver juntas e agir como se estivessem loucamente apaixonadas? FaÃ­scas. Isso Ã© o que acontece. Eles vÃ£o sobreviver ao contrato?

Dinheiro Ã© Emocional: SaÃºde emocional para ter paz financeira
Tiago Brunet
22 de marÃ§o de 2018

R$Â 20,00
R$Â 13,00
  Â As pessoas imaginam que o seu dinheiro estÃ¡ ligado Ã  economia do paÃ­s, ao emprego atual, ao talento para os negÃ³cios ou Ã s oportunidades da vida. Apesar de concordar que, indiretamente, todos estes fatores influenciam sua vida financeira, Tiago Brunet mostra que o ponto crucial sÃ£o as emoÃ§Ãµes. Elas sÃ£o o fator determinante do que significa dinheiro para vocÃª e de como vocÃª o usa.
Â Se dinheiro Ã© emocional, primeiro precisamos estar convictos de que somos saudÃ¡veis emocionalmente, para depois pensar em ganhar e administrar recursos.
Â EmÂ Dinheiro Ã©Â emocional, Tiago apresenta como sua experiÃªncia como coach e mentor de dezenas de lÃ­deres empresariais, polÃ­ticos e religiosos o levou a entender sobre como o que controla nossas emoÃ§Ãµes tambÃ©m governa o nosso destino financeiro. Dinheiro no bolso sem propÃ³sito, Ã© dinheiro perdido.
Â Tiago conduz vocÃª, leitor, atravÃ©s desta obra, a um avanÃ§ado estÃ¡gio de saÃºde emocional e financeira, para que vocÃª conheÃ§a e desfrute do verdadeiro sentido da prosperidade. Afinal: â€œProsperidade nÃ£o Ã© ter dinheiro, e sim tudo o que vocÃª precisa para cumprir o seu destino nesta terraâ€

Rodrigo Alvarez

R$Â 31,99
R$Â 20,15
  Escrito pelo autor laico brasileiro que mais vende livros de temÃ¡tica religiosa no Brasil, Jesus â€“ O homem mais amado da HistÃ³ria: a biografia daquele que ensinou a humanidade a amar e dividiu a HistÃ³ria em antes e depois Ã© o livro mais atual sobre a vida do homem cuja histÃ³ria mantÃ©m seu vigor e interesse hÃ¡ mais de dois mil anos. O escritor e jornalista Rodrigo Alvarez tomou como base as fontes arqueolÃ³gicas e bibliogrÃ¡ficas mais recentes, alÃ©m das mais antigas (entre eles diversos manuscritos originais), e viajou pelos mesmos lugares percorridos por Jesus em seu tempo para reconstituir os passos do pregador que, ao mesmo tempo Deus e homem, ensinou a amar, mudou o curso da humanidade e dividiu a HistÃ³ria em antes e depois. Com uma narrativa elegante, acessÃ­vel e guiada pelos fatos, alÃ©m de ricamente ilustrado, Jesus â€“ O homem mais amado da HistÃ³ria Ã© um livro sobre um Jesus de antes do cristianismo e de todas as suas divisÃµes futuras â€“ e que mostra a todos os leitores, cristÃ£os ou nÃ£o, a relevÃ¢ncia e a permanÃªncia de sua trajetÃ³ria e de seus ensinamentos.
